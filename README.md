# pdbtest

## Usage
python -m pdbtest [module]

(after the pattern of python -m unittest [module])

## Description

`pdbtest` shims the unittest test runner machinery to, when a test fails due to
an exception, print some information about the `TestCase` and `test_method`, and
then launch the PDB interactive debugger, affording you the opportunity to
easily examine the failure.

The library also provides a `PDBRunnerMixin` class that you can mix in to your
test runner to achieve the same effect, and a modified `TestProgram` that will
automatically shim the runner you provide and can be used in the same way as
`unittest.TestProgram`.
